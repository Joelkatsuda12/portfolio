           <p class='body_text'>Takashi Murakami is a Japanese contemporary artist that popularized the "Superflat style" that combines bold, vibrant colors with striking imagery and flat perspective. He is well known for incorporating symbols like flowers and his famous "Mr DOB" into his work to tell layered stories about history, culture, and people.

           <p class='body_text'>Mac Miller was a music artist whose progression from rap to psychedelic to jazz to neo-soul visualized his love and ability in music. I think about design in the same way in that I always want to branch into new areas of creativity. I also learned from him to find simplicity in design, and to always give your work a sense of personality and liveliness. </p>
